     <P>I am married and have 2 handsome, sweet and waild boys.
     <P>I am orginally from iran.I came in USA in 2012.I work for chick-fil-a resturant as a cashier for 1 year,until I was 30 weeks pregnant.<br>
        2 Year after I had my baby,I started to work as a childcare teacher Assistant  at a montessori school.I work as a childcare teacher for over 4 years.
        I was left the job for maternity leave for my seconsd child,that covit-19 hit,and I Couldnt go back to work.</P>
        <p>
            so I couldnt work for cuple of months,because of the schools were closed,and even when they opened the school I was not feeling safe to take my infant to school. that was when I start to think of a job, that I can do it at home too.I decided to study web development,because I was always curious about how the websites and app are working.
            because I couldnt aford to pay for childcare while I am studing,also paying the class tuition.I start to study at my free times,after i put the kids to sleep at nights.
