       <P>I am married and have 2 handsome, sweet and active boys.
      I was born in Iran in 1991 .I came in USA in 2012,with my parents, and my husband.I work for chick-fil-a resturant as a cashier for 1 year, until I was 30 weeks pregnant.<br>
      2 Year after I had my baby, I started to work as a childcare teacher Assistant at a montessori school. I work as a childcare teacher for over 4 years.
      I left the job for maternity leave for my seconsd child,that covit-19 hit, and I Couldnt go back to work.</P>
        <p>
               I couldnt work for cuple of months,because of the schools were closed. Even, when the schools got open again I was not feeling safe to take my infant to school. That was when I start to think of a job,that I can do it at home too.
            I decided to study web development,because I was always curious about how the websites and app are working.
            because I couldnt afford to pay for childcare while I am studing, also paying the class tuition. I start to study at my free times.specifically, after I was putting  the kids to sleep at nights.
            <p>As a result, I was able to code, and make basic projects after 6 months of studying at home.After that, I attanded to, 12 weeks coding bootcamp,and that really helped me to boost my skills as a web developer.
